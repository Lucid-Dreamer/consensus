\renewcommand{\Moves}{
  \DEFAULTMOVE{Universal Programmer}{When you \TRIGGER{make a new
      piece of equipment}, roll +Wits. On a hit you make it. On a 10+,
    it works and keeps working. On a 7-9, it will only last for the
    scene. In either case, choose a quirk:
    \begin{itemize}
      \setlength\itemsep{-.5em}
    \item The device works much more slowly than expected
    \item The device requires more of a resource than expected
    \item The device has a side effect when used
    \end{itemize}
  }
  \MOVE{Read the Web of Fate}{When you \TRIGGER{enter the virtual
      world to Read the Web of Fate}, roll +Grace. On a hit, you can
    determine the degrees of separation between two objects or
    people. On a 10+, you can also get a general idea of the path
    between them.}
  \MOVE{Hacking}{When you \TRIGGER{Outmaneuver, Outpace, or Outfox in
      the virtual world}, you may roll +Wits instead of +Grace}
  \MOVE{Ghost in the Machine}{When you \TRIGGER{enter the Virtual
      World physically}, you may bring other willing Mages along, and
    exit at any terminal you can find.}
  \MOVE{Things Speak}{When you \TRIGGER{examine an interesting
      technological or magical object}, roll +Wits. On a 10+, you may
    ask up to 3 of the following questions, on a 7-9, ask 1.
    \begin{itemize}
      \setlength\itemsep{-.5em}
    \item What strong emotions have been most recently associated with
      this?
    \item What's wrong with this, and how might I fix it?
    \item How frequently has this been handled?
    \item Where did this come from?
    \item How might this be dangerous?
    \item Who designed this?
    \end{itemize}
  }
  \MOVE{Percussive Maintenance}{When you \TRIGGER{Impose Your Will} on
    a machine, roll +Will. It works better. On a 10+, tell the GM
    how. On a 7-9, the GM will tell you how. On a 6-, the GM will tell
    you how, and why this is terrible for you.}
}
\renewcommand{\Paradigms}{
  \PARADIGM{Reality has an API}{Changing a single variable, Magic done
    from a terminal}{Choose this one: Living things}{Choose one:
    Unplanned magic, magic not done from a terminal}
