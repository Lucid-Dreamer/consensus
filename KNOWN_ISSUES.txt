The biggest problem is that we would like to replace Secrets and
Highlighting. Secrets are a somewhat clunky system, though they have
provided good character backstory connections, and Highlighting isn't
terribly interesting or thematic as a way to gain XP (and also, PCs
have been gaining XP surprisingly quickly if they try).

Aligned/unaligned magic doesn't seem great.

It is seeming like we need some kind of simple "money/other nonmagical
resources" abstraction.
