  \begin{move}
    When you fail a roll on a magical action and decide to \TRIGGER{put
      willpower behind changing it}, the GM may ask you some
    questions. Answer them honestly. Re-roll the roll with +1 and choose
    2:
    \begin{itemize}
      \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item Lose a Playbook move until the end of the session
    \item Take -1 ongoing until you actually fail a magical roll
    \item You gain the attention of something powerful
    \end{itemize}
  \end{move}

  \SEPARATOR
  
  \begin{move}
    When you fail a roll with no magical influence, and decide to
    \TRIGGER{use magic to fix it}, treat the result plus your stat as a
    7, and choose 2:
    \begin{itemize}
      \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item Take 2 harm, or 2 Discord
    \item The magic is Rending
    \item You put yourself in a spot
    \end{itemize}
  \end{move}

  \SEPARATOR

  \begin{move}
    When you \TRIGGER{suffer harm} (even 0 harm), roll +Harm suffered. On a 10+, the GM can choose 1:
    \begin{itemize}
      \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item You're out of action: unconscious, trapped, incoherent, or
      panicked.
    \item Take the full Harm of the attack, before it was reduced by
      preparations. If you already took the full Harm of the attack, take
      +1 Harm.
    \item You are shaken. Take -1 ongoing until you can spend time
      connecting with an Anchor.
    \end{itemize}
    On a 7-9, the GM can choose 1:
    \begin{itemize}
      \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item You lose your footing
    \item You lose your grip on whatever you're holding
    \item You let something or someone you're attending to fall into
      danger (especially important if it's an Anchor).
    \item Something you weren't prepared for happens.
    \end{itemize}
    
  \end{move}

  \columnbreak
  
  \begin{move}
    When you have time, relative safety, and a place of power, and you
    \TRIGGER{begin a ritual} of magical power, describe the effect you
    want. The GM will say which of these are needed (it may be more
    than one):
    \begin{itemize}
      \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item Extra time
    \item A certain object
    \item Help from an outside source
    \item More information
    \end{itemize}
    When you perform the ritual, roll +Will. On a 10+ it works as
    expected. On a 7-9 the GM will choose at least one.
    \begin{itemize}
      \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item The ritual takes longer than expected
    \item You draw unwanted attention
    \item The ritual causes Discord
    \item Everyone involved Backlashes
    \item The ritual has greater than intended effects
    \item (other options here)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{move}

  \begin{move}
    When \TRIGGER{one of your Anchors is put in danger}, mark
    experience and either go and handle it, or lose them as an
    Anchor.
  \end{move}

  \SEPARATOR

  \begin{move}
    When you \TRIGGER{lose an Anchor}, roll +Anchors left. On a 10+,
    it may take some time, but you'll get through this. On a 7-9,
    choose 1:
    \begin{itemize}
      \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item Another Anchor gets put in danger
    \item You do something you will regret. The GM tells you
      what. \textit{Note: This means it does \textbf{not} cause
        another Anchor to get put in danger}
      \item You Backlash
    \end{itemize}
    On a miss: Lose another Anchor. The GM will tell you which one and
    how.
  \end{move}

  \columnbreak

  \begin{move}
    At the \TRIGGER{end of session}: ask yourselves these questions as
    a group. For every one you answer ``yes'' to, everyone marks
    experience. In addition, pick a PC that knows you better now. They
    get +1 Secrets with you.
    \begin{itemize}
      \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item Did you show the lengths you were willing to go to in order
      to protect an Anchor?
    \item Did you uncover a secret?
    \item Did you learn something that puts your paradigms in
      perspective, or caused you to question them?
    \item Did you discover something new about the dark side of magic?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{move}

  \SEPARATOR
  
  \begin{move}
    When your \TRIGGER{Harm reaches Code N}, roll +Body. On a 10+ you
    stabilize, and will need medical care, but you should live. On a
    7-9, some serious magic is going to be needed to help you survive,
    plus the medical care. On a 6-, you're about to bite the
    dust. Make peace with your Paradigm.

    If you have two or less Anchors, you have the option of removing
    an Anchor in order to stabilize. Describe how you spiritually cut
    yourself off from the Anchor, infusing yourself with magic in
    order to heal, but taking a huge step away from reality in doing
    so.
  \end{move}

  \SEPARATOR

  \begin{move}
    When you \TRIGGER{expend, consume, or sacrifice a resource which
      is pertinent, uncommon, and powerful, on a magical effect}, the
    effect is greater than it otherwise would be. The GM will tell you
    how.
  \end{move}  

  \SEPARATOR
  
  \begin{move}
    When \TRIGGER{your Secrets with someone reaches +4 or -4}, reset
    Secrets to 0, learn a new secret about them, and mark experience.
  \end{move}
