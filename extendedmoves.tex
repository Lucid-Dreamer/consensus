  \begin{move}
    When you fail a roll on a magical action and decide to \TRIGGER{put
      willpower behind changing it}, the GM may ask you some
    questions. Answer them honestly. Re-roll the roll with +1 and choose
    2:
    \begin{itemize}
      \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item Lose a Playbook move until the end of the session
    \item Take -1 ongoing until you actually fail a magical roll
    \item You gain the attention of something powerful
    \end{itemize}
  \end{move}

  \SEPARATOR
  
  \begin{move}
    When you fail a roll with no magical influence, and decide to
    \TRIGGER{use magic to fix it}, treat the result plus your stat as a
    7, and choose 2:
    \begin{itemize}
      \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item Take 2 harm, or 2 Discord
    \item The magic is Rending
    \item You put yourself in a spot
    \end{itemize}
  \end{move}

  \SEPARATOR

  \begin{move}
    When you \TRIGGER{help or hinder} another PC, roll +Secrets. On a
    10+ they get a +1 or -2 to their roll, your choice. On a 7-9 they
    still get the bonus or penalty, but you open yourself to cost,
    danger, or retribution. On a hit, Secrets +1. On a miss, Secrets
    -1.
  \end{move}

  \columnbreak
  
  \begin{move}
    When you have time, relative safety, and a place of power, and you
    \TRIGGER{begin a ritual} of magical power, describe the effect you
    want. The GM will say which of these are needed (it may be more
    than one):
    \begin{itemize}
      \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item Extra time
    \item A certain object
    \item Help from an outside source
    \item More information
    \end{itemize}
    When you perform the ritual, roll +Will. On a 10+ it works as
    expected. On a 7-9 the GM will choose at least one.
    \begin{itemize}
      \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item The ritual takes longer than expected
    \item You draw unwanted attention
    \item The ritual causes Discord
    \item Everyone involved Backlashes
    \item The ritual has greater than intended effects
    \item (other options here)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{move}

  \SEPARATOR

  \begin{move}
    When your \TRIGGER{Harm reaches Code N}, roll +Body. On a 10+ you
    stablize, and will need medical care, but you should live. On a
    7-9, some serious magic is going to be needed to help you survive,
    plus the medical care. On a 6-, you're about to bite the
    dust. Make peace with your Paradigm.
  \end{move}

  \columnbreak

  \begin{move}
    At the \TRIGGER{end of session}: ask yourselves these questions as
    a group. For every one you answer ``yes'' to, everyone marks
    experience. In addition, pick a PC that knows you better now. They
    get +1 Secrets with you.
    \begin{itemize}
      \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item Did you actively work to preserve the dying magic of this
      world?
    \item Did you uncover a secret?
    \item Did you learn something that puts your paradigms in
      perspective, or caused you to question them?
    \item Did you discover something new about the dark side of magic?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{move}

  \SEPARATOR
  
  \begin{move}
    When \TRIGGER{your Secrets with someone reaches +4 or -4}, reset
    Secrets to 0, learn a new secret about them, and mark experience.
  \end{move}
