    When you fail a roll on a magical action and decide to \TRIGGER{put
      willpower behind changing it}, the GM may ask you some
    questions. Answer them honestly. Re-roll the roll with +1 and choose
    2:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Lose a Playbook move until the end of the session
    \item Take -1 ongoing until you actually fail a magical roll
    \item You gain the attention of something powerful
    \end{itemize}
  \end{move}

  \begin{move}
    When you fail a roll with no magical influence, and decide to
    \TRIGGER{use magic to fix it}, treat the result plus your stat as a
    7, and choose 2:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Take 2 harm, or 2 Discord
    \item The magic is Rending
    \item You put yourself in a spot
    \end{itemize}
  \end{move}
