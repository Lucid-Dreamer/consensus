\begin{multicols}{3}

  \begin{move}
    When you \TRIGGER{impose your will} on someone, roll +Will. On a
    10+, they do what you want or they get the hell out of your
    way. On a 7-9, they may choose to instead:
    \begin{itemize}
      \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item Give you something they think you want or need
    \item Offer to help, at a cost
    \item Bunker down until this blows over
    \item Make themselves scarce
    \end{itemize}
  \end{move}

  \SEPARATOR
  
  \begin{move}
    When you \TRIGGER{pull one over} (on a person or on the Universe),
    roll +Wits. On a 10+, you've done it, with no-one the wiser. On a
    7-9 you trip up, hesitate, or falter. The GM will over you a hard
    bargin, worse outcome, or tough choice.
  \end{move}

  \SEPARATOR

  \begin{move}
    When you \TRIGGER{demonstrate your magical superiority} over
    another Mage, roll +Charm - Anchors. On a hit, they take +1 or -1
    Secrets with you, their choice. Then, on a 10+, hold 3, or on a
    7-9, hold 1. You can spend your hold 1 for 1 to:
    \begin{itemize}
      \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item Have them mark experience
    \item Give them a +1 or -1 on their next roll
    \item Cause their current Paradox to backlash
    \end{itemize}
    On a miss, they hold 1 against you, on the same terms.
  \end{move}

  \SEPARATOR

  \begin{move}
    When you \TRIGGER{use a sleeper} for your own ends, you must first
    have something they want. Roll +Charm. On a success, they will do
    what you want. On a 10+, they will do what you want to the best of
    their abilities. On a 7-9, they need proof that they'll get what
    they want, or they need it before they'll do anything for you.
  \end{move}

  \columnbreak
  
  \begin{move}
    When you \TRIGGER{outmaneuver, outpace, or outfox}, roll
    +Grace. On a 10+, you're scott free. On a 7-9, choose 2, or let
    the GM choose the worst 1:
    \begin{itemize}
      \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item You stumble, trip up, or falter
    \item You attract attention
    \item You have to leave something behind
    \item You leave an obvious trail
    \end{itemize}
  \end{move}

  \SEPARATOR

  \begin{move}
    When you \TRIGGER{keep your head down} to avoid attention, roll
    +Wits. On a 10+, you avoid notice, suspicion, or detection. On a
    7-9, someone, but not everyone, notices you. Choose two:
    \begin{itemize}
      \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item They keep quiet about it
    \item They weren't actively looking for you
    \item They don't start to follow you
    \item They don't have backup
    \end{itemize}
  \end{move}

  \SEPARATOR

  \begin{move}
    When you \TRIGGER{do Rending magic} and it affects a Lookout, gain
    2 Discord, Backlash, and roll +nothing (the Consensus doesn't care
    how smart or sexy you are).

    On a 10+ choose up to 3, on a 7-9 choose exactly 2.
    \begin{itemize}
      \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item You only gain 1 Discord
    \item You don't Backlash
    \item You don't cause collateral damage
    \item You don't draw extra attention
    \end{itemize}
    On a miss, choose one, but not ``You don't Backlash.''
  \end{move}

  \columnbreak
  
  \begin{move}
    When you \TRIGGER{exert yourself} physically on the world or another
    person, roll +Body. On a 10+, choose 3. On a 7-9, choose 2:
    \begin{itemize}
      \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item You accomplish your goal
    \item You aren't injured in the process
    \item You don't cause any collateral damage
    \item You impress or dismay the target or onlookers
    \end{itemize}
  \end{move}

  \SEPARATOR

  \begin{move}
    When you \TRIGGER{Backlash}, roll +Discord, then reset Discord to
    0.

    On a 10+ choose 1:
    \begin{itemize}
      \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item You are sucked into a Quiet
    \item You are sucked into a Discordant Realm
    \end{itemize}

    On a 7-9, choose 2:
    \begin{itemize}
      \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item You take 3 Harm
    \item You don't reset your Discord to 0
    \item A Discordant Sign manifests
    \item A Consensus Enforcer manifests
    \end{itemize}

    On a miss, you shake it off with minimal lasting effects.
  \end{move}

  \SEPARATOR

  \begin{move}
    When you \TRIGGER{help or hinder} another PC, roll +Secrets. On a
    10+ they get a +1 or -2 to their roll, your choice. On a 7-9 they
    still get the bonus or penalty, but you open yourself to cost,
    danger, or retribution. On a hit, Secrets +1. On a miss, Secrets
    -1.
  \end{move}
