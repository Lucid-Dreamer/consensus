\MOVE{Just When I Think You're Gone}{When you \textbf{pass up an
    opportunity to interact with your Source of Inspiration}, roll
  +Grace. On a hit, hold 1. On a 10+ you may spend your hold 1 for 1
  to have your source appear in the scene with no explanation
  needed. On a 7-9 you may spend your hold for the same, but your
  Source is threatened, captured, or in peril.}

\MOVE{Open Their Mind}{When you \textbf{introduce an individual to
    your Source to open their mind}, roll +Charm. On a 10+, they are
  not a witness the next time they would be for your magic. On a 7-9,
  you take +1 forward with them. On a 6-, in addition to whatever else
  the GM says, choose one:
  \begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{-.5em}
  \item They find they have a strong aversion to your Source
  \item They wish to take your Source away from you.
  \end{itemize}
}

\MOVE{Opiate for the Masses}{When you \textbf{bring your Source to a
    mob}, roll +Grace. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 1. Spend your
  hold 1-for-1 to:
  \begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{-.5em}
  \item Discover a truth that they know
  \item Obtain something of value or use
  \item Get them to believe a truth
  \item Learn their potential
  \item Placate them and return them to their mundane lives
  \end{itemize}
}

\MOVE{Visions of Fate}{When you \textbf{jump into the havoc surging
    around you}, roll +Body. On a 10+, choose someone who pulls
  through, and someone who doesn't. On a 7-9, choose someone who pulls
  through OR someone who doesn't. Don't name a PC; name NPCs only. The
  GM will make your prediction come true, if it's even remotely
  possible. On a miss, take -1 ongoing until the havoc subsides.}
